## Description

In this era of technology, many things already simplified by the technology named **smartphone**. There are already much things can be done by smartphone such as calling, texting, video conferencing, banking activities, shopping, controlling some home appliances, listening to music, watching videos, etc. However, there are some valuable documents which is still in the physical state such as ID Card, birth certificate, land certificate, driving license card, etc. Those physical documents are also really vulnerable because of the possibility of losing, theft, and also force majures. Dokmas (Dokumen Masyarakat) can solve those kind of problems by being the trusted app in smartphones to store those important documents in secured cloud storage. So, everytime the user needs the document for some specific purposes, user doesn't need to bring those physical form of the documents, user can just use this app in their smartphone and show the needed documents. This also prevents losing, theft, and some other human factors such as forgetfulness and so on.
